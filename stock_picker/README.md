# Agentic Stock Analysis System

This project is a sophisticated multi-agent system built with the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to perform long-term stock analysis. It uses a team of specialized AI agents, orchestrated by a Chief Investment Officer (CIO) agent, to gather and synthesize financial data, market sentiment, and economic trends into a comprehensive investment thesis.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Implements a robust Coordinator/Dispatcher pattern where a high-level agent manages a team of specialists.
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has a distinct responsibility:
  - **ChiefInvestmentOfficer**: The coordinator. It delegates tasks and synthesizes the final report. Powered by `gemini-2.5-pro`.
  - **FundamentalAnalyst**: The "Quant." Analyzes financial health and valuation metrics using the `yfinance` library. Powered by `gemini-2.5-flash`.
  - **MarketSentimentAnalyst**: The "Storyteller." Gauges public perception and news using Google Search. Powered by `gemini-2.5-flash`.
  - **EconomicAndIndustryAnalyst**: The "Strategist." Researches the broader economic and industry landscape using Google Search. Powered by `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- **Extensible Tooling**: Combines a custom `FunctionTool` for structured data (`yfinance`) with the powerful built-in `google_search` tool for real-time, unstructured information.
- **Structured Output**: Uses Pydantic models to ensure reliable data handling between tools and agents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **User Query**: The user asks the `ChiefInvestmentOfficer` for an analysis of a specific stock (e.g., "Should I invest in Microsoft (MSFT) for the long term?").
2.  **Delegation**: The CIO agent calls its specialist agents as tools in a specific sequence: first fundamentals, then sentiment, then economic outlook.
3.  **Data Gathering**: The specialist agents execute their assigned tasks using their respective tools.
4.  **Synthesis & Final Report**: The CIO receives the individual reports and synthesizes them into a single, coherent investment thesis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

This project assumes you have already followed the setup instructions in the main repository's `README.md` (installing ADK, setting your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, etc.).

You only need to install this agent's specific dependencies:

```bash
pip install yfinance pydantic
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the `Agentic-Apps` repository.
2.  Ensure your virtual environment is active and your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set.
3.  Launch the ADK Web UI:
    ```bash
    adk web
    ```
4.  Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
5.  Select the `stock_picker` agent from the dropdown menu and start your query.
